              This definition is not shared by the Bibale or Oxford Libraries’ conception
              of the term, which both define their internal “work” concept more closely to
              the FRBRoo conception of an Expression. The SDBM does not have a work concept
              at all, recording only the titles of the texts as given in its various sources,
              without normalizing that data or linking it directly to author information.
              Works were generated within the MMM dataset by manually creating links across
              the three datasets’ various conceptions of the relationship between authors
              and their creations. This process was not able to reconcile every work
              contained within the combined dataset.

        Using the MMM Portal
      </h1>
      <h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
        General Idea
      </h2>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
        The MMM Portal enables you to search and browse through most of the data assembled by 
        the MMM project from the three source databases. In addition, the portal is equipped 
        with ready-to-use tools for Digital Humanities research using the 
        <a href="https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/publications/2020/hyvonen-sampos-dhn-2020.pdf" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>
        "Sampo" model</a> where the portal is used as follows:
      </p>
      <ol class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
      <li class="MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
          On the front page of the portal different perspectives to the data are given as a selection, here Manuscripts, 
          Works, Events, Actors, and Places. The idea is to provide access to the underlying data (knowledge graph) 
          through multiple use cases while the underlying data remains the same.
        </li>
        <li class="MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
          After selecting a perspective, faceted search  can be used for filtering out a subset of objects of the view, 
          the “target group” of interest. For example, manuscripts by a given author in a time period can be selected. 
          By default each perspective displays all results from the corresponding class (Manuscripts, Works, Events, Actors, 
          or Places). This default result set can be narrowed down by using the filters.
        </li>
        <li class="MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
          Finally, data analysis and visualization tools can be applied to study the target group. For example, it is possible 
          to see on maps how the manuscripts have moved from the place of production to their last known location ("Migrations" 
          tab on the Manuscripts perspective). Map-based visualizations are available also in the Actors and Places perspectives.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
        Using the "Export" tab in a perspective and then the button "Open SPARQL query in YASGUI" the SPARQL query corresponding to 
        the facet selections made is shown in the 
        <a href="https://yasgui.triply.cc" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>
        YASGUI</a> SPARQL querying interface with the results. Additional YASGUI tools for studying the results and downloading 
        the data are available there. For example, the results of the query can be downloaded in CSV format for additional 
        spreadsheet computing.

        Using a Single Filter in Faceted Search
      </h2>
      <h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
        Selecting values within a filter
      </h3>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
        All possible values for a filter are displayed either as a list or as a hierarchical 
        tree (if available). The number of results is shown in brackets for each value. 
        Once a value is selected, the results are automatically updated. To prevent further 
        selections that do not return any results, also the possible values for all other 
        filters are updated at the same time.
      </p>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
        Multiple values can be selected within a single filter. Selecting multiple values
        generates results that contain <strong>any</strong> of the selected values. For example, selecting
        both <i>Saint Augustine</i> and <i>Saint Jerome</i> as an Author returns results that
        include either <i>Saint Augustine</i> <strong>OR</strong> <i>Saint Jerome</i> as an Author.
      </p>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
        Selected values of a filter appear in the Active filters section at the top of the list
        of filters. To deselect a filter, click the X mark next to it within the Active filters
        section. You can also deselect a filter value by unchecking the checkmark in the
        filter’s value list. The Active filters section only appears if there are filter
        values currently selected.
      </p>
      <h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
        Searching categories within a filter
      </h3>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
        Category selections within a filter can be searched by using the search field at the 
        top of each filter. All possible values of a filter remain visible at all times. 
        The values of the filter that match the search term are indicated by a purple underline. 
      </p>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
        Steps for searching within filters:
      </p>
      <ol class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
        <li class="MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
          Type search term into search field. If there are matches, a number
          will appear to the right of the search field, indicating the number
          of filter values that match the search term.
        </li>
        <li class="MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
          Click the arrows " <  > " to the right of the search field to cycle through 
          the results. As you click the arrow, a different filter value will appear 
          at the top of the list. Matched filters are underlined in purple.
        </li>
        <li class="MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
          Click the checkmark next to a filter value to activate it. 
          The results (and also other filters) are automatically updated. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>      
      <h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
        Using Multiple Filters Simultaneously
      </h2>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
        The effectiveness of faceted search is realized when multiple filters are
        applied at the same time. As in many e-commerce sites, a logical AND is
        always used between the filters. 
      </p>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
        For example selecting <i>Saint Augustine </i>
        and <i>Saint Jerome</i> as an Author and <i>Sir Thomas Phillipps</i> and
        <i> Thomas Thorpe</i> as an Owner, the results are narrowed down as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">
        (Author: <i>Saint Augustine</i> <strong>OR</strong> Author: <i>Saint Jerome</i>)
      </p>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">
          <strong>AND</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">
        (Owner: <i>Sir Thomas Phillipps</i> <strong>OR</strong> Owner: <i>Thomas Thorpe</i>)
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
        In faceted search you can make selections in filters in any order, and the hit 
        counts in the other filters are automatically updated. In this way you never end 
        up in "no hits" dead ends.
